THE bunk house was a long, rectangular building. Inside, the
walls were whitewashed and the floor unpainted. In three walls
there were small, square windows, and in the fourth, a solid door
with a wooden larch. Against the walls were eight bunks, five of
them made up with blankets and the other three showing their
burlap ticking. Over each bunk there was nailed an apple box with
the opening forward so that it made two shelves for the personal
belongings of the occupant of the bunk. And these shelves were
loaded with little articles soap and talcum powder, razors and
those Western magazines ranch men love to read and scoff at and
secretly believe. And there were medicines on the shelves, and
little vials, combs; and from nails on the box sides, a few neckties.
Near one wall there was a black cast-iron stove, its stovepipe
going straight up through the ceiling. In the middle of the room
stood a big square table littered with playing cards, and around it
were grouped boxes for the players to sit on.
At about ten oâ€™clock in the morning the sun threw a bright dust-
laden bar through one of the side windows, and in and out of the
beam flies shot like rushing stars.
The wooden latch raised. The door opened and a tall, stoop-
shouldered old man came in. He was dressed in blue jeans and he
carried a big push broom in his left hand. Behind him came
George, and behind George, Lennie.
