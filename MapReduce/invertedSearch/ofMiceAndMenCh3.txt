ALTHOUGH there was evening brightness showing through the
windows of the bunk house, inside it was dusk. Through the open
door came the thuds and occasional clangs of a horseshoe game,
and now and then the sound of voices raised in approval or
derision.
Slim and George came into the darkening bunk house together.
Slim reached up over the card table and turned on the tin-shaded
electric light. Instantly the table was brilliant with light, and the
cone of the shade threw its brightness straight downward, leaving
the corners of the bunk house still in dusk. Slim sat down on a box
and George took his place opposite.
"It wasn't nothing," said Slim. "I would of had to drowned most of
'em anyways. No need to thank me about that."
George said, "It wasn't much to you, maybe, but it was a hell of a
lot to him. Jesus Christ, I don't know how we're gonna get him to
sleep in here. He'll want to sleep right out in the barn with 'em.
We'll have trouble keepin' him from getting right in the box with
them pups."
