72. Preeya Khanna received a B.S.E in Bioengineering and Mathematics from the University of Pennsylvania in 2012, and a Ph.D in the Joint Graduate Group in Bioengineering from UC Berkeley and UCSF in 2017. She completed her postdoctoral training in the Department of Neurology at UCSF. Her research combines sensorimotor systems neuroscience, network modeling, and neurotechnology development with the goal of uncovering principles of how distributed brain networks coordinate to control skillful dexterous movements. These principles are then leveraged to design neurophysiologically-grounded brain-machine interface therapies such as neurofeedback and myoelectric feedback paradigms, and neuromodulation approaches for restoring movement control in patients with damaged sensorimotor systems.
